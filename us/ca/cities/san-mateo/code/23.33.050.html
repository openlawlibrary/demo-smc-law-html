                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(h)(2)">(2)</span> Within an adopted regulatory floodway, the City shall prohibit encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements, and other development, unless certification by a registered civil engineer is provided demonstrating that the proposed encroachment shall not result in any increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(h)(3)">(3)</span> All new construction and substantial improvements must comply with all other applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of this section.</p>
