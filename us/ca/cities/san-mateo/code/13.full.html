The request for such a permit may only be made by the owner or owners of the property on which the trees are located or for pruning by an adjacent property owner of heritage tree limbs extending onto that adjacent property, after notice of the application to the property owner where the heritage tree is located. Heritage tree permits are valid for six months from date of issue. Extensions may be authorized by the Director. The applicant may submit an arborist's report with the permit application to show cause for removal or pruning. Pruning permit applications shall include pruning specifications prepared by a certified arborist.</p>
                <p>The Director shall review each application and shall consider and determine the following in rendering a decision:</p>
