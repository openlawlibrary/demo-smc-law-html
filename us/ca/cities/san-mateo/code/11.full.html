This activity has brought increased traffic to already congested areas, causes drivers along these streets to be distracted, and results in vehicles making unsafe stops so the vehicle driver or occupant can discuss employment with workers. Additionally, workers will from time-to-time dart out into the street to solicit employment, creating a safety hazard to themselves and the motoring public. The regulations enacted in <a class="internal-link no-wrap" href="/us/ca/cities/san-mateo/code/11.58" title="Chapter 11.58 ROADWAY SOLICITATION">this chapter</a> are intended to eliminate these safety hazards.</p>
