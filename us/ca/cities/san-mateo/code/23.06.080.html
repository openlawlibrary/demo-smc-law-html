Every such application shall:</p>
          <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(a)(1)">(1)</span> Identify and describe the work to be covered by the permit for which the application is made.</p>
          <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(a)(2)">(2)</span> Describe the land on which the proposed work is to be done by legal description, street address or similar description that will readily identify and definitely locate the proposed building or work.</p>
          <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(a)(3)">(3)</span> Indicate the use or occupancy for which the proposed work is intended.</p>
          <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(a)(4)">(4)</span> Be accompanied by plans, diagrams, computations and specifications, and other data as required in subsection (b).</p>
          <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(a)(5)">(5)</span> State the valuation of any new building or structure or any addition, remodeling or alteration to an existing building.</p>
          <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(a)(6)">(6)</span> Be signed by the applicant, or the applicant's authorized agent.</p>
          <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(a)(7)">(7)</span> Give such other data and information as may be required by the building official.</p>
          <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(b)">(b)</span> <span class="level-heading">Submittal Documents.</span> Plans, specifications, engineering calculations, diagrams, soil investigation reports, special inspection and structural observation programs and other data shall constitute the submittal documents and shall be submitted in one or more sets with each application for a permit. When such plans are not prepared by an architect or engineer, the building official may require the applicant submitting such plans or other data to demonstrate that State law does not require that the plans be prepared by a licensed architect or engineer. The building official may require plans, computations and specifications to be prepared and designed by an engineer or architect licensed by the State to practice as such even if not required by State law.</p>
          <p><strong>Exception: </strong>The building official may waive the submission of plans, calculations, construction inspection requirements and other data if it is found that the nature of the work applied for is such that reviewing of plans is not necessary to obtain compliance with this code.</p>
          <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(c)">(c)</span> <span class="level-heading">Information on Plans and Specifications.</span> Plans and specifications shall be drawn to scale on substantial paper or cloth and shall be of sufficient clarity to indicate the location, nature and extent of the work proposed and show in detail that it will conform to the provisions of this code and all relevant laws, ordinances, rules and regulations.</p>
          <p>Plans for buildings of other than Group R, Division 3 and Group U Occupancies shall indicate how required structural and fire-resistive integrity will be maintained where penetrations will be made for electrical, mechanical, plumbing and communication conduits, pipes and similar systems.</p>

          <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(d)(1)">(1)</span> <span class="level-heading">General.</span> When it is required that documents be prepared by an architect or engineer, the building official may require the owner to engage and designate on the building permit application an architect or engineer who shall act as the architect or engineer of record. If the circumstances require, the owner may designate a substitute architect or engineer of record who shall perform all the duties required of the original architect or engineer of record. The building official shall be notified in writing by the owner if the architect or engineer of record is changed or is unable to continue to perform the duties.</p>
          <p>The architect or engineer of record shall be responsible for reviewing and coordinating all submittal documents prepared by others, including deferred submittal items, for compatibility with the design of the building.</p>
          <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(d)(2)">(2)</span> <span class="level-heading">Deferred Submittals.</span> For the purposes of this section, deferred submittals are defined as those portions of the design which are not submitted at the time of the application and which are to be submitted to the building official within a specified period.</p>
          <p>Deferral of any submittal items shall have prior approval of the building official. The architect or engineer of record shall list the deferred submittals on the plans and shall submit the deferred submittal documents for review by the building official. Submittal documents for deferred submittal items shall be submitted to the architect or engineer of record who shall review them and forward them to the building official with a notation indicating that the deferred submittal documents have been reviewed and that they have been found to be in general conformance with the design of the building. The deferred submittal items shall not be installed until their design and submittal documents have been approved by the building official.</p>

The inspection program shall designate the portions of the work to have special inspection, the name or names of the individuals or firms who are to perform the special inspections and indicate the duties of the special inspectors.</p>
          <p>The special inspector shall be employed by the owner, the engineer or architect of record, or an agent of the owner, but not the contractor or any other person responsible for the work.</p>
          <p>When structural observation is required by <a class="internal-link " href="/us/ca/cities/san-mateo/code/23.06.140" title="23.06.140 STRUCTURAL OBSERVATION.">Section 23.06.140</a>, the inspection program shall name the individuals or firms who are to perform structural observation and describe the stages of construction at which structural observation is to occur.</p>
