At such time it shall find whether or not the proposed keeping of such fowl and rodents would be injurious to the health, safety or welfare of the City. It shall thereupon allow, or deny, such applications, or make such provisions for modifications thereof, and with reference thereto, as it may see fit. Appeals of the Commission's decision may be made to the City Council by filing in writing within 10 calendar days of the hearing and paying the required filing fee.</p>
