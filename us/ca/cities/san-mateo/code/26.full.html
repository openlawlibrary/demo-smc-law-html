                <p>In the application of these regulations, consideration will be given, within the established framework of local streets, to the provision of uniformity of street widths where appropriate and for a properly relating alignment of street names. Preservation of the privacy and safety of streets in residential areas shall be encouraged by the prevention of through traffic in such areas. The width and design of the streets required shall be directly related to the vehicular and pedestrian traffic-generating characteristics of the anticipated uses of the abutting land. Traffic capacities shall be provided to meet anticipated external travel needs, where appropriate. The number of intersections on thoroughfares shall be kept to a minimum consistent with the basic needs of ingress and egress. Intersections shall be so designed as to provide optimum safety for pedestrians and motorists and other users of the streets. Provisions shall be made for assuring adequate light, air and privacy on all parcels of property regardless of the land use. Topography and vegetation of exceptional character shall be respected, and streets shall be designed so as to prevent excessive grading and scarring of the landscape. Special care shall be taken in the design and construction to provide stable soil and subsoil conditions. Problems of drainage shall be resolved in such manner as to provide substantial security against excessive runoff or flooding, earth movements and excessive erosion.</p>

                <p>The conversion of residential, commercial and industrial structures from single person or entity ownership to condominiums, stock cooperatives, or community apartments with multiple ownership interests creates special community problems, both social and economic. Given the relative lack of rental construction over the past eight years, conversions may significantly affect the balance between rental and ownership housing within the City (which may affect future economic growth); reduce the variety of individual choices of tenure, type, price, and, location of housing; increase overall rents; decrease the supply of rental housing for low and moderate income persons and families; and disregard the needs of the prevailing consumer market. The purpose of <a class="internal-link no-wrap" href="/us/ca/cities/san-mateo/code/26.65" title="Chapter 26.65 CONVERSIONS TO CONDOMINIUMS, STOCK COOPERATIVES AND COMMUNITY APARTMENTS">this chapter</a> is to provide guidelines to evaluate those problems, the impact any conversion application may have on the community and to establish requirements which shall be included in any conversion approval.</p>
