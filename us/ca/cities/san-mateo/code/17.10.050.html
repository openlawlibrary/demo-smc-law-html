                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(a)">(a)</span> <span class="level-heading">Application Required.</span> The approval authority shall not approve any request for a minor wireless permit, major wireless permit, section 6409 approval or temporary wireless permit except upon a complete and duly filed application consistent with this Section and any other written rules the City or the Director may establish from time to time in any publicly-stated format.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(b)">(b)</span> <span class="level-heading">Application Content.</span> All applications for a minor wireless permit, major wireless permit, section 6409 approval or temporary wireless permit must include all the information and materials required by the Director for the application. The City Council authorizes the Director to develop, publish and from time to time update or amend permit application requirements, forms, checklists, guidelines, informational handouts and other related materials that the Director finds necessary, appropriate or useful for processing any application governed under <a class="internal-link no-wrap" href="/us/ca/cities/san-mateo/code/17.10" title="Chapter 17.10 WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS FACILITIES IN THE PUBLIC RIGHT-OF-WAY">this Chapter</a>. All applications shall, at a minimum, (1) require the applicant to demonstrate that the proposed project will be in planned compliance with all applicable health and safety laws, regulations or other rules, which includes without limitation all building codes, electric codes and all FCC rules for human exposure to RF emissions and (2) contain sufficient evidence (such as a valid CPCN) of the applicant's regulatory status as a telephone corporation under the <a class="internal-link " href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codesTOCSelected.xhtml?tocCode=PUC&amp;tocTitle=+Public+Utilities+Code+-+PUC" title="">California Public Utilities Code</a>. The City Council further authorizes the Director to establish other reasonable rules and regulations, which may include without limitation regular hours for appointments with applicants, as the Director deems necessary or appropriate to organize, document and manage the application intake process. All such rules and regulations must be in written form and publicly stated to provide applicants with prior notice.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(c)">(c)</span> <span class="level-heading">Procedures for a Duly Filed Application.</span> Any application for a major wireless permit, minor wireless permit or section 6409 approval will not be considered duly filed unless submitted in accordance with the procedures in this Section. Any application for a temporary wireless permit must be filed in accordance with the procedures in <a class="internal-link no-wrap" href="/us/ca/cities/san-mateo/code/17.10.110" title="17.10.110 TEMPORARY WIRELESS FACILITIES.">Section 17.10.110</a>.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(c)(1)">(1)</span> <span class="level-heading">Pre-Submittal Conference.</span> Before application submittal, the applicant must schedule and attend a pre-submittal conference with the Director for all proposed projects (a) subject to a major wireless permit; (b) that involve the deployment of more than five (5) facilities in the public right-of-way; or (c) that involve collocation, modification or other change to an existing concealed facility submitted with a request for approval pursuant to Section 6409. Pre-submittal conferences for all other proposed projects are strongly encouraged but not required. The pre-submittal conference is intended to streamline the review process through informal discussion that includes, without limitation, the appropriate project classification and review process, any latent issues in connection with the proposed or existing wireless tower or base station, including compliance with generally applicable rules for public health and safety; potential concealment issues or concerns (if applicable); coordination with other City departments responsible for application review; and application completeness issues. To mitigate unnecessary delays due to application incompleteness, applicants are encouraged (but not required) to bring any draft applications or other materials so that City staff may provide informal feedback and guidance about whether such applications or other materials may be incomplete or unacceptable. The Department shall use reasonable efforts to provide the applicant with an appointment within five (5) working days after receiving a written request and any applicable fee or deposit to reimburse the City for its reasonable costs to provide the services rendered in the pre-submittal conference.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(c)(2)">(2)</span> <span class="level-heading">Submittal Appointment.</span> All applications must be submitted to the City at a pre-scheduled appointment with the Director. Applicants may generally submit one application per appointment but may schedule successive appointments for multiple applications whenever feasible and not prejudicial to other applicants. The Director shall use reasonable efforts to provide the applicant with an appointment within five (5) working days after the Director receives a written request and, if applicable, confirms that the applicant complied with the pre-submittal conference requirement. Any application received without an appointment, whether delivered in-person, by mail or through any other means, will not be considered duly filed unless the applicant received a written exemption from the Director at a pre-submittal conference.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(d)">(d)</span> <span class="level-heading">Informational Neighborhood Meeting.</span> For any application subject to a minor wireless permit or major wireless permit proposed in or within 500 feet from a residential zone, the applicant must provide notice and an opportunity for an informational neighborhood meeting. Informational neighborhood meetings shall occur before any application is deemed complete and are intended to provide the community in the immediately affected area an opportunity to learn about the applicant's proposal and give the applicant feedback.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(d)(1)">(1)</span> <span class="level-heading">Notice.</span> The applicant shall provide written notice posted at the proposed project site and mailed by first class U.S. mail to all residents, property owners and other persons or entities entitled to receive notice under <a class="internal-link no-wrap" href="/us/ca/cities/san-mateo/code/17.10.060" title="17.10.060 NOTICE.">Section 17.10.060</a> and the Director. The notice shall: (1) clearly state the applicant's name; (2) describe the proposed site location and the proposed improvements and other equipment to be constructed or installed, which shall include photo simulations, samples or renderings that depict the finished installation in context with the surrounding natural and built environment; (3) identify when the construction, installation, excavation or other work would begin and end; (4) provide a contact name and telephone number for the applicant's representative and the Department; and (5) clearly state that the notice recipient has 15 calendar days from the date on the notice to submit a written request to the City for an informational neighborhood meeting or else no such meeting will be held.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(d)(2)">(2)</span> <span class="level-heading">Request for Meeting.</span> If the City receives a timely request for an informational neighborhood meeting, the City will inform the applicant and the applicant shall provide at least 10 days prior written notice to all persons entitled to notice under <a class="internal-link no-wrap" href="/us/ca/cities/san-mateo/code/17.10.060" title="17.10.060 NOTICE.">Section 17.10.060</a> that such a meeting will take place. The notice shall: (1) contain all the same information required under <a class="internal-link no-wrap" href="/us/ca/cities/san-mateo/code/17.10.060#(c)" title="">Section 17.10.060(c)</a>; and (2) provide the meeting date, time and location to present and discuss the proposed wireless facility. If the City does not receive a timely request for an informational neighborhood meeting, no meeting will be required.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(d)(3)">(3)</span> <span class="level-heading">Meetings.</span> Informational neighborhood meetings shall be held at an accessible location within the City, preferably at or near the location where the proposed site is or will be located. The applicant shall conduct the meeting, bring a scaled, three-dimensional mock-up of the proposed installation, and be prepared to answer questions posed by attendees. The meeting shall be held for at least one hour; provided, however, that the meeting may be closed earlier if no one arrives within the first 20 minutes after the noticed start time or if all attendees have had a reasonable opportunity to be heard. City staff may attend in an observational capacity. No official action may be taken by the City at any informational neighborhood meeting.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(e)">(e)</span> <span class="level-heading">Applications Deemed Withdrawn.</span> To promote efficient review and timely decisions, any application governed under <a class="internal-link no-wrap" href="/us/ca/cities/san-mateo/code/17.10" title="Chapter 17.10 WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS FACILITIES IN THE PUBLIC RIGHT-OF-WAY">this Chapter</a> will be automatically deemed withdrawn by the applicant when the applicant fails to tender a substantive response to the Department within 90 calendar days after the Director deems the application incomplete in a written notice to the applicant. The Director may, in the Director's discretion, grant a written extension for up to an additional 30 calendar days when the applicant submits a written request prior to the 90th day that shows good cause to grant the extension. Delays due to circumstances outside the applicant's reasonable control will be considered good cause to grant the extension.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(f)">(f)</span> <span class="level-heading">Peer and Independent Consultant Review.</span></p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(f)(1)">(1)</span> <span class="level-heading">Authorization.</span> The City Council authorizes the Director to, in the Director's discretion, select and retain an independent consultant with specialized training, experience and/or expertise in telecommunications issues satisfactory to the Director in connection any permit application.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(f)(2)">(2)</span> <span class="level-heading">Scope.</span> The Director may request an independent consultant review on any issue that involves specialized or expert knowledge in connection with wireless facilities deployment or permit applications for wireless facilities, which include without limitation: (a) permit application completeness and/or accuracy; (b) pre-construction planned compliance with applicable regulations for human exposure to RF emissions; (c) post-construction actual compliance with applicable regulations for human exposure to RF emissions; (d) whether and to what extent a proposed project will address a gap in the applicant's wireless services; (e) whether and to what extent any technically feasible and/or potentially available alternative sites or concealment techniques may exist; (f) the applicability, reliability and/or sufficiency of any information, analyses or methodologies used by the applicant to reach any conclusions about any issue with the City's discretion to review; and (g) any other issue identified by the Director that requires expert or specialized knowledge. The Director may request that the independent consultant prepare written reports, testify at public meetings, hearings and/or appeals and attend meetings with City staff and/or the applicant.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(f)(3)">(3)</span> <span class="level-heading">Consultant Fees; Deposit.</span> In the event that the Director elects to retain an independent consultant in connection with any permit application, the applicant shall be responsible for the reasonable costs in connection with the services provided, which may include without limitation any costs incurred by the independent consultant to attend and participate in any meetings or hearings. Before the independent consultant may perform any services, the applicant shall tender to the City a deposit in an amount equal to the estimated cost for the services to be provided, as determined by the Director. The Director may request additional deposits as reasonably necessary to ensure sufficient funds are available to cover the reasonable costs in connection with the independent consultant's services. In the event that the deposit exceeds the total costs for consultant's services, the Director shall promptly return any unused funds to the applicant after the wireless facility has been installed and passes a final inspection by the appropriate City official or his or her designee. In the event that the reasonable costs for the independent consultant's services exceed the deposit, the Director shall invoice the applicant for the balance. The City shall not issue any construction or grading permit to any applicant with any unpaid deposit requests or invoices.</p>
