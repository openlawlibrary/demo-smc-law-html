                <p>At such time as this Ordinance becomes effective, the Director shall begin the process of replacing Freestanding Newsracks with Modular Newsracks within the Mandatory Modular Area. For this initial replacement process, space within Modular Newsracks in the Mandatory Modular Area shall be assigned in the following order of priority:</p>

A random selection from all of the participating Publishers for each non-site specific space shall be made by rounds. At such time as a Publisher has determined it has sufficient space for its needs, its name shall be eliminated from subsequent rounds. When the number of remaining rounds is the same as the original number of participating Publishers, the Director shall ask if any Publishers have yet to receive any compartment space. All Publishers who have yet to receive any compartment space shall then be given one compartment space. Any remaining spaces shall be randomly selected by rounds, as before, until there are no remaining spaces. A second random selection shall determine the specific location that each space will be assigned. Trading, selling, giving or other method of transferring assigned space to another Publisher, person or entity shall not be allowed. Any Publisher desiring additional space after the lottery process is complete shall be placed on the priority list discussed in subsection (d) below.</p>

A priority list shall be created by the Director for the determination of assignment of compartment space as vacancies occur after the initial modular assignments under subsection (a) or (b) above. Priorities when vacancies occur in Modular Newsracks shall be established in the following order: (1) Publications maintaining permitted Free Standing Newsracks within the Mandatory Modular Area on June 18, 2002, that were not able to secure the desired number of spaces in Modular Newsracks as a result of the lottery procedure implemented pursuant to Subsection (a)., above, or were not included in any stipulated plan implemented under Subsection (b), above. If there are more than one Publication meeting this definition, priority within such group shall be based upon whichever historically has maintained Freestanding Newsracks in the Mandatory Modular Area for the longest period of time; (2) other Publications shall be given priority based upon the chronological sequence of the submittal of permit applications ("first-come, first-served" basis).</p>
                <p>Priorities shall be recorded on a priority list maintained by the Director. Placement on the priority list shall entitle the Publisher to the next available vacant space when its name comes to the top of the list. If the Publisher declines the next available space, it may rather choose to be placed at the bottom of the priority list. If thereafter the Publisher desires additional spaces, its name shall be placed again at the bottom of the list and another space provided when its name comes up again. A Publisher who is not then currently on the priority list may be placed on the list at any time by filing a permit application for Compartment space within the Mandatory Modular Area. As an alternative to being placed upon the priority list, a Publisher may choose to apply for a new Modular Newsrack location under <a class="internal-link no-wrap" href="/us/ca/cities/san-mateo/code/17.12.060" title="17.12.060 ISSUANCE AND EXPIRATION OF PERMIT.">section 17.12.060</a> (b)(2).</p>

                <p>Abandoned shopping carts constitute a nuisance, create potential hazards to the health and safety of the public, and interfere with pedestrian and vehicular traffic within the City of San Mateo. The accumulation of wrecked, dismantled and abandoned shopping carts on public or private property also tends to create conditions that reduce property values, promoting blight and deterioration in the City. The intent of <a class="internal-link no-wrap" href="/us/ca/cities/san-mateo/code/17.29" title="Chapter 17.29 SHOPPING CART REMOVAL, IMPOUNDMENT, DISPOSAL">this chapter</a> is to insure that measures are taken by store owners to prevent the removal of shopping carts from store premises and parking lots, to make the removal of shopping carts a violation of this Code, and to facilitate the retrieval of abandoned carts as permitted by State law.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="/us/ca/cities/san-mateo/code/17.34.080#(b)(1)">(1)</span> Filing. The applicant shall file the application with the chairperson as soon as possible, but no later than seven working days before the event. An application may be filed up to five working days before the event, but an applicant filing fewer than seven working days before the event waives the right to appeal a decision. If an event is planned in response to a contemporaneous public event or decision which could not have been known in advance, the applicant may file an application 48 hours before the event. The review period is to ensure adequate time for review of the proposed arrangements by the affected City departments, establishing reasonable conditions, notification of the decision, and appeal from the decision.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="/us/ca/cities/san-mateo/code/17.34.080#(b)(2)">(2)</span> Chairperson's Decision. The chairperson shall approve the permit application, subject to conditions, or shall deny the permit in accordance with the findings set forth in subsection (a). The chairperson shall take action to approve or deny within 48 hours (not including days the City offices are closed) after receipt of a completed application. The chairperson shall notify the applicant in writing (and orally, if possible) of the decision, including a statement of the reasons for any conditions or the grounds for a denial. If a change in the time or location of the proposed event would allow approval of the application, the chairperson shall propose an alternative to the applicant.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="/us/ca/cities/san-mateo/code/17.34.080#(b)(3)">(3)</span> Applicant's Acceptance (or Appeal). The applicant shall notify the chairperson in writing of the applicant's acceptance within 24 hours (not including days the City offices are closed) after written notice of the decision. The failure to submit a timely acceptance or appeal is deemed an automatic withdrawal of the application. If the applicant files a valid written acceptance and complies with the general permit conditions, the permit issues upon the chairperson's receipt of the written acceptance. The chairperson shall notify the applicant, the City Council, the City Manager, and any affected department head that the permit has been issued consistent with the notification process identified in the special event procedures.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="/us/ca/cities/san-mateo/code/17.34.080#(b)(4)">(4)</span> Appeal. An applicant who has filed the initial application at least seven working days before the event may appeal the decision, including a denial, a condition of approval, a refusal to waive a filing deadline, or a decision regarding fees or insurance, by filing a written appeal on a form prescribed by the chairperson. The appeal procedures are set forth in <a class="internal-link no-wrap" href="/us/ca/cities/san-mateo/code/17.34" title="Chapter 17.34 SPECIAL EVENTS">this chapter</a>.</p>

At the time of filing, the City shall request that the court hear the matter as soon as possible and no later than two court days after the filing.</p>
