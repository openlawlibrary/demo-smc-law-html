Such release or return of the cash deposit shall not waive any rights of the City nor obligations of the permittee as to any latent or concealed defect in any repair or restoration which was, or should have been, performed under the permit. Where latent or concealed defects are discovered after the permittee has had his or her cash deposit returned, the Director of Public Works shall notify the permittee of this discovery, who shall, within three (3) days of such notification, undertake to correct such defects as exist, or shall be liable to the City for the cost of performing, or having performed, such correction.</p>

If the amount on deposit should be inadequate, or has been returned or released, the Director of Public Works shall cause the permittee to be billed by the City for the full amount of such costs borne by the City, including administrative overhead, as are incurred in performing, or having performed, the work for which the permittee is obligated to have performed hereunder.</p>
