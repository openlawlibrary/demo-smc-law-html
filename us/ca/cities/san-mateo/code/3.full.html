                <p>The purpose of this ordinance is to establish purchasing procedures for the City of San Mateo. The City Council finds that a flexible purchasing system that allows for consideration of price, quality, reliability, workmanship, compatibility of products (such as computers and cellular equipment or design and furniture), and other relevant factors is in the public's best interests and that no single factor should be determinative in every case.</p>
                <p>The City Council further finds that the complexity of City of San Mateo purchases and construction contracts, in conjunction with the complexities of the private marketplace, require that city staff and this Council have flexibility to select among the purchasing alternatives set forth in this ordinance in order to obtain the best products, services, and construction in the public's interest.</p>
