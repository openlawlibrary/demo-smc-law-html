                  <strong>FINDINGS FOR LOCAL AMENDMENTS TO CALIFORNIA GREEN BUILDING STANDARDS CODE, 2016 EDITION</strong>

                <p><a class="internal-link " href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?sectionNum=17958&amp;lawCode=HSC" title="">Section 17958 of the California Health and Safety Code</a> provides that the City may make changes to the provisions in the uniform codes that are published in the California Building Standards Code.  Sections <a class="internal-link no-wrap" href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?sectionNum=17958.5&amp;lawCode=HSC" title="">17958.5</a> and <a class="internal-link no-wrap" href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?sectionNum=17958.7&amp;lawCode=HSC" title="">17958.7</a> of the <a class="internal-link " href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codesTOCSelected.xhtml?tocCode=HSC&amp;tocTitle=+Public+Utilities+Code+-+HSC" title="">Health and Safety Code</a> require that for each proposed local change to those provisions in the uniform codes and published in the California Building Standards Code which regulate buildings used for human habitation, the City Council must make findings supporting its determination that each such local change is reasonably necessary because of local climatic, geological, or topographical conditions.</p>
                <p>Local building regulations having the effect of amending the uniform codes, which were adopted by the City prior to November 23, 1970, were unaffected by the regulations of Sections <a class="internal-link no-wrap" href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?sectionNum=17958&amp;lawCode=HSC" title="">17958</a>, <a class="internal-link no-wrap" href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?sectionNum=17958.5&amp;lawCode=HSC" title="">17958.5</a> and <a class="internal-link no-wrap" href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?sectionNum=17958.7&amp;lawCode=HSC" title="">17958.7</a> of the <a class="internal-link " href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codesTOCSelected.xhtml?tocCode=HSC&amp;tocTitle=+Public+Utilities+Code+-+HSC" title="">Health and Safety Code</a>.  Therefore, amendments to the uniform codes which were adopted by the City Council prior to November 23, 1970, and have been carried through from year to year without significant change, need no required findings.  Also, amendments to provisions not regulating buildings used for human habitation, including amendments made only for administrative consistency, do not require findings.</p>

                  <strong>Key to Justification for Amendments to Title 24 of the California Code of Regulations</strong>
                </p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="">A.</span> This amendment is justified on the basis of a local <strong><u>climatic</u></strong> condition.</p>
                <p>Failure to address and significantly reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions could result in rises in sea level, including in San Francisco Bay, that could put at risk City homes and businesses, public facilities, and Highway 101 (Bayshore Freeway), particularly the mapped Flood Hazard areas of the City. Electric vehicle charging infrastructure is a key component in reducing GHG emissions, and EV charging installations can help the City of San Mateo reduce its share of the GHG emissions that contribute to climate change. Electric vehicle charging infrastructure will contribute to the reduction of GHG emissions by supporting the demand for electric vehicles and the associated EV chargers. The burning of fossil fuels used in the generation of electric power and heating of buildings contributes to climate change, which could result in rises in sea level, including in San Francisco Bay, that could put at risk City homes and businesses, public facilities, and Highway 101. However, electric power will become cleaner over time as utilities achieve more stringent Renewable Portfolio Standard requirements, and translate the clean energy benefits to electric vehicles. Due to decrease in annual rain fall, the City experiences the effect of drought and water saving more than some other communities in California.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="">B.</span> Energy efficiency and water conservation enhances the public health and welfare by promoting the <strong><u>environmental</u></strong> and economic health of the City through the design, construction, maintenance, operation and deconstruction of buildings and sites by incorporating green practices into all development. The provisions in <a class="internal-link no-wrap" href="/us/ca/cities/san-mateo/code/23.70" title="Chapter 23.70 GREEN BUILDING CODE">this Chapter</a> are designed to achieve the following goals:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="">(a)</span> Increase energy efficiency in buildings;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="">(b)</span> Increase water and resource conservation;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="">(c)</span> Provide durable buildings that are effcient and economical to own and operate;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="">(d)</span> Promote the health and productivity of resients, workers, and visitors to the city;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="">(e)</span> Recognize and conserve the eergy embodied in existing buildings; and</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="">(f)</span> Reduce disturbance of natural ecosystems.</p>
