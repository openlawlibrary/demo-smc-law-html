          <p>WHEREAS, <a class="internal-link " href="/us/ca/cities/san-mateo/charter#2.16" title="2.16 EMERGENCY ORDINANCES.">City Charter Section 2.16</a> provides that the City Council, to protect public peace health, safety, and welfare, may adopt as an emergency ordinance, an ordinance passed by a majority plus one of the City Council; and</p>
          <p>WHEREAS, the City has received interest from commercial operators in operating electric scooter businesses in the City; and</p>
          <p>WHEREAS, the commercial operation of electric scooter businesses is designed such that electric scooters are left in place at any location in the City and often within the public right of way; and</p>
          <p>WHEREAS, City staff has monitored electric scooter commercial operations in other California communities and noted the following safety issues:</p>
          <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="">(a)</span> Cities in which electric scooter businesses operate have observed an increase in scooter-related injuries including broken bones, head injuries, and a few fatalities.</p>
          <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="">(b)</span> Electric scooters can achieve speeds of up to 15 miles per hour and while electric scooters are intended for use on streets they are often operated on sidewalks, which poses a safety threat to pedestrians.</p>
          <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="">(c)</span> Electric scooters provided by commercial operators are often left in place on the public right of way. Electric scooters are very easily knocked over thus posing a tripping hazard to pedestrians and obstructing the right of way.</p>
          <p>WHEREAS, in accordance with <a class="internal-link " href="/us/ca/cities/san-mateo/charter#2.16" title="2.16 EMERGENCY ORDINANCES.">City Charter Section 2.16</a>, an emergency ordinance expires on the 91st day after its adoption but may be re-enacted if the emergency still exists; and</p>
          <p>WHEREAS, on November 19, 2018 the City Council of the City of San Mateo adopted an emergency ordinance temporarily prohibiting the commercial operation of electric scooter businesses; and</p>
          <p>WHEREAS, the emergency ordinance was scheduled to expire on February 17, 2019; and</p>
          <p>WHEREAS, on February 4, 2019 the City Council of the City of San Mateo reenacted the emergency for another 90 days; and</p>
          <p>WHEREAS, the reenacted emergency ordinance expired on May 5, 2019; and</p>
          <p>WHEREAS, staff continues to have concerns regarding the safety of electric scooters for users, pedestrians, and motor vehicles; and</p>
          <p>WHEREAS, staff is proposing regulations for shared mobility operators including electric scooter businesses in order to protect public peace, health, safety and welfare; and</p>
          <p>WHEREAS, the proposed shared mobility regulations are not yet adopted; and</p>
          <p>NOW, THEREFORE, THE CITY COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF SAN MATEO, CALIFORNIA, HEREBY ORDAINS that:</p>
