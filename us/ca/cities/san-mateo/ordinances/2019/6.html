                <p>WHEREAS, from time to time residential rental units in San Mateo have severe code violations which threaten the life and safety of occupants; and</p>
                <p>WHEREAS, these hazardous living conditions often require that the tenants vacate the structure to allow for extensive repairs or demolition of the structure; and</p>
                <p>WHEREAS, when these code violations are caused by the negligence or postponed maintenance by the property owner, or when the property owner allows the improper use of a structure as a residence, relocation benefits and assistance are necessary to ensure that displaced tenants secure safe, sanitary and decent replacement housing; and</p>
                <p>WHEREAS, property owners who fail to properly maintain residential rental properties, and/or create substandard residential rental units should bear responsibility for the hardships their actions (or inaction) create for the tenant; and</p>
                <p>WHEREAS, relocation costs are a necessary component of code enforcement that should be borne by the property owner, and the City should be reimbursed by the responsible owner for relocation-related costs that it incurs in the code enforcement process; and</p>
                <p>WHEREAS, requiring property owners to pay relocation costs will encourage them to promptly correct code violations and protect the public health, safety and general welfare of San Mateo residents; and</p>
                <p>WHEREAS, the relocation payment obligations imposed on property owners by this ordinance are intended as the City's local program for advancing relocation payments to displaced tenants, consistent with, and in addition to, Tenant Relocation Assistance provisions in the <a class="internal-link " href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codesTOCSelected.xhtml?tocCode=HSC&amp;tocTitle=+Public+Utilities+Code+-+HSC" title="">California Health and Safety Code</a>, Regulation of Buildings Used for Human Habitation; and</p>
                <p>WHEREAS, the relocation assistance provided for in this ordinance reflects the actual costs of relocation likely to be incurred by displaced tenant household in particular, moving costs and the cost of first and last months' rent, as well as other costs associated with involuntary dislocation; and</p>
                <p>WHEREAS, the purpose of this ordinance is to require that property owners whose tenants are displaced, either temporarily or permanently, due to City code enforcement activities, receive from property owners' payments to alleviate hardships associated with such displacements, thereby protecting and enhancing the health and safety of San Mateo residents; and</p>
                <p>WHEREAS, this ordinance provides an appeal process to allow property owners and tenant households to contest decisions, orders, or determinations made by the City regarding relocation payments or notices of penalties or fines imposed under <a class="internal-link no-wrap" href="/us/ca/cities/san-mateo/code" title="City of San Mateo Municipal Code.">this Chapter</a>; and</p>
                <p>WHEREAS, this ordinance amends other, existing sections within <a class="internal-link no-wrap" href="/us/ca/cities/san-mateo/code/26.65" title="Chapter 26.65 CONVERSIONS TO CONDOMINIUMS, STOCK COOPERATIVES AND COMMUNITY APARTMENTS">Chapter 26.65</a> "Conversions to Condominiums, Stock Cooperatives, and Community Apartments" of <a class="internal-link no-wrap" href="/us/ca/cities/san-mateo/code/26" title="Title 26 SUBDIVISIONS">Title 26</a> "Subdvisions" and <a class="internal-link no-wrap" href="/us/ca/cities/san-mateo/code/27.02" title="Chapter 27.02 GENERAL PROVISIONS">Chapter 27.02</a> General Provisions of <a class="internal-link no-wrap" href="/us/ca/cities/san-mateo/code/27" title="Title 27 ZONING">Title 27</a> "Zoning" of the Municipal Code to make the relocation assistance required by those sections consistent with the relocation assistance provided in this ordinance.</p>
