                <p class="text-indent-1 quote"><span class="level-num" id="">(a)</span> <span class="level-heading">Generally Applicable Design Regulations.</span> All new wireless facilities and collocations, modifications or other changes to existing wireless facilities not covered under Section 6409 must conform to the generally applicable design regulations in this Section and the design and engineering standards adopted by the Director of Public Works.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 quote"><span class="level-num" id="">(1)</span> <span class="level-heading">General Concealment.</span> All wireless facilities must be concealed to the maximum extent feasible with design elements and techniques that mimic or blend with the underlying support structure, surrounding environment and adjacent uses and should promote attractive, harmonious, and economic use of property, buildings, civic facilities, and conform with an preserve the overall aesthetics and character of City neighborhoods. In addition, wireless facilities may not unreasonably subject the public use, for any purpose including expressive or aesthetic purposes, to inconvenience, discomfort, trouble, annoyance, hindrance, impediment or obstruction.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 quote"><span class="level-num" id="">(A)</span> <span class="level-heading">Undergrounded Equipment.</span> To conceal the equipment to the maximum degree feasible, applicants must install all equipment (other than the antenna, antenna supports, ancillary wires, cables and any electric meter) underground in any area in which the existing utilities are not primarily located above ground. In all other areas, applicants shall install all equipment (other than the antenna, antenna supports, ancillary wires, cables and any electric meter) underground when the approval authority finds that the above-ground equipment would unreasonably interfere with the public's ability to use the right-of-way for uses that include without limitation travel, social, expressive and/or aesthetic uses. When making a determination on whether to require undergrounded equipment, the approval authority shall take into account whether and to what extent any other above-ground utilities exist near the proposed site. Mere additional expense to install and maintain an underground equipment enclosure does not exempt an applicant from this requirement.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 quote"><span class="level-num" id="">(B)</span> <span class="level-heading">Pole-Mounted Equipment.</span> All pole-mounted equipment must be installed as close to the pole as technically and legally feasible to minimize the overall visual profile. All pole-mounted equipment and required or permitted signage must face toward the street or otherwise placed to minimize visibility from adjacent sidewalks and structures. All cables, wires and other connectors must be routed through conduits within pole whenever possible, and all external conduits, conduit attachments, cables, wires and other connectors must be concealed from public view to the extent feasible. Equipment mounted below any streetlight must not interfere with the illumination provided to the public rights-of-way from such streetlight.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 quote"><span class="level-num" id="">(C)</span> <span class="level-heading">Ground-Mounted Equipment.</span> In general, the City strongly disfavors all ground-mounted equipment. To the extent that the equipment cannot be placed underground or mounted on the pole, applicants may be permitted to install ground-mounted equipment in a location that does not obstruct pedestrian or vehicular traffic. All ground-mounted equipment must be placed in the least conspicuous location available within a reasonable distance from the pole and/or be installed within an existing or replacement street feature including, without limitation, bus stop shelters, trash bins, benches, kiosks, advertisement panels or other street furniture to conceal the equipment. The approval authority may condition approval on new or enhanced landscaping to conceal ground-mounted equipment. Ground-mounted cabinets installed on residential frontage are strongly disfavored.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 quote"><span class="level-num" id="">(2)</span> <span class="level-heading">Overall Height.</span> Wireless facilities in the public rights-of-way may not exceed either (i) the minimum separation from supply lines required by CPUC General Order 95, as may be amended or superseded, plus four feet or (ii) four feet above the height of the existing support structure. Legally required lightning arresters and beacons shall be included when calculating the height of facilities.</p>

The approval authority may require the applicant to incorporate appropriate noise-baffling materials and/or strategies whenever necessary to avoid any ambient noise from equipment reasonably likely to exceed the applicable level.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 quote"><span class="level-num" id="">(5)</span> <span class="level-heading">Landscaping.</span> All wireless facilities must include landscape features and a landscape maintenance plan when proposed to be placed in a landscaped area. The approval authority may require additional landscape features to screen the wireless facility from public view, avoid or mitigate potential adverse impacts on adjacent properties or otherwise enhance the concealment required under this Section. All plants proposed or required must be native and/or drought-resistant.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 quote"><span class="level-num" id="">(6)</span> <span class="level-heading">Site Security Measures.</span> Wireless facilities may incorporate reasonable and appropriate site security measures, such as locks and anti-climbing devices, to prevent unauthorized access, theft or vandalism. All wireless facilities shall be constructed from graffiti-resistant materials.

The approval authority shall not approve barbed wire, razor ribbon, electrified fences or any similar security measures.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 quote"><span class="level-num" id="">(7)</span> <span class="level-heading">Backup Power Sources.</span> The approval authority may not approve permanent backup power sources within the public rights-of-way.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 quote"><span class="level-num" id="">(8)</span> <span class="level-heading">Lights.</span> Wireless facilities may not include exterior lights other than as may be required under FAA, FCC, other applicable governmental regulations or applicable pole owner policies related to public or worker safety. All exterior lights permitted or required to be installed must be installed in locations and within enclosures that mitigates illumination impacts on other properties to the maximum extent feasible. Any lights associated with the electronic equipment shall be appropriately shielded from public view. The provisions in this subsection shall not be interpreted to prohibit installations on street lights or the installation of luminaires on new poles when required by the approval authority.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 quote"><span class="level-num" id="">(9)</span> <span class="level-heading">Signage; Advertisements.</span> All wireless facilities must include signage that accurately identifies the equipment owner/operator, the owner/operator's site name or identification number and a toll-free number to the owner/operator's network operations center. Wireless facilities may not bear any other signage or advertisements unless expressly approved by the City, required by law or recommended under existing and future FCC or other United States governmental agencies for compliance with RF emissions regulations.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 quote"><span class="level-num" id="">(10)</span> <span class="level-heading">Future Collocations and Equipment.</span> To the extent feasible and aesthetically desirable, all new wireless facilities should be designed and sited in a manner that accommodates potential future collocations and equipment installations that can be integrated into the proposed wireless facility or its associated structures with no or negligible visual changes to the outward appearance. The approval authority may waive the requirements in this Section when the approval authority determines future collocations at a proposed wireless facility would be aesthetically undesirable.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 quote"><span class="level-num" id="">(11)</span> <span class="level-heading">Utilities.</span> All cables and connectors for telephone, primary electric and other similar utilities must be routed underground to the extent feasible in conduits large enough to accommodate future collocated wireless facilities. To the extent feasible, undergrounded cables and wires must transition directly into the pole base without any external doghouse. Meters, panels, disconnect switches and other associated improvements must be placed in inconspicuous locations to the extent possible. The approval authority shall not approve new overhead utility lines or service drops merely because compliance with the undergrounding requirements would increase the project cost. Microwave or other wireless backhaul is discouraged when it would involve a separate and unconcealed antenna.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 quote"><span class="level-num" id="">(12)</span> <span class="level-heading">Compliance with Laws.</span> All wireless facilities must be designed and sited in compliance with all applicable federal, state and local laws, regulations, rules, restrictions and conditions, which includes without limitation the California Building Standards Code, Americans with Disabilities Act, General Plan and any applicable specific plan, the San Mateo Municipal Code and any conditions or restrictions in any permit or other governmental approval issued by any public agency with jurisdiction over the project.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 quote"><span class="level-num" id="">(13)</span> <span class="level-heading">Public Safety.</span> All wireless facilities shall not interfere with access to a fire hydrant, fire station, fire escape, water valve, underground vault, valve housing structure or any other public health or safety facility. No person shall install, use or maintain any facilities, which in whole or in part rest upon, in or over any public right-of-way, when such installation, use or maintenance endangers or is reasonably likely to endanger the safety of persons or property, or when such site or location is used for public utility purposes, public transportation purposes or other governmental use, or when such facilities unreasonably interfere with or unreasonably impede the flow of pedestrian or vehicular traffic including any legally parked or stopped vehicle, the ingress into or egress from any residence or place of business, the use of poles, posts, traffic signs or signals, hydrants, mailboxes, permitted sidewalk dining, permitted street furniture or other objects permitted at or near the location where the wireless facilities are located.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 quote"><span class="level-num" id="">(b)</span> <span class="level-heading">Facilities on Existing Support Structures.</span> All wireless facilities in the public rights-of-way must be installed on existing above-ground structures (such as light standards or utility poles) whenever possible and aesthetically desirable. The approval authority shall not approve any wireless facility proposed to be installed on a traffic control pole unless the approval authority finds, in the approval authority's discretion, that the traffic control pole has sufficient capacity to support the wireless facility. Wireless facilities shall not be installed on existing decorative street light standards.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 quote"><span class="level-num" id="">(c)</span> <span class="level-heading">Facilities on Replacement Support Structures.</span> Existing above-ground structures may be replaced with structurally hardened, fitted or reinforced support structures so long as the replacement structure is, in the approval authority's discretion, substantially similar to the existing structure to be replaced. Unless an applicant can demonstrate that the installation of a steel pole is not feasible or the approval authority determines that a wood pole is needed to match the existing poles in the vicinity, new wood poles shall only be allowed to replace existing wood poles.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 quote"><span class="level-num" id="">(d)</span> <span class="level-heading">Facilities on New Support Structures.</span> The approval authority shall not approve any new, non-replacement support structures unless: (1) the applicant demonstrates that above-ground support structures within 500 feet from the proposed site location either do not exist or are not technically feasible or potentially available to the applicant; or (2) the approval authority specifically finds that a new, non-replacement support structure would be more aesthetically desirable and consistent with the objectives in the General Plan and any applicable specific plan, the San Mateo Municipal Code and <a class="internal-link no-wrap" href="/us/ca/cities/san-mateo/code/17.10" title="Chapter 17.10 WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS FACILITIES IN THE PUBLIC RIGHT-OF-WAY">this Chapter</a> than installations on existing structures near the project site. The approval authority shall have the discretion to require that any new support structure must be: (a) concealed as decorative street furniture and/or (b) a streetlight that conforms to the City's streetlight standards and specifications, which the City shall maintain for street illumination and public safety purposes.</p>

Any extension must be the minimum time period necessary to avoid such extreme economic hardship. The Director may not grant any permanent exemption from this section.</p>

Nothing in this section is intended or may be applied to prohibit any collocation or modification covered under 47 U.S.C.
