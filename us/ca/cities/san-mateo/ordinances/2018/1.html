          <p>WHEREAS, the procedures set forth in Article XIIID <a class="internal-link " href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?sectionNum=6&amp;lawCode=Constitution of the State of California" title="">§ 6 of the California State Constitution</a> (Proposition 218) for property-related fees apply to sewer service charge increases; and</p>
          <p>WHEREAS, the City is following the procedure set forth in Article XIIID § 6 for this Sewer Service Charge increase; and</p>
          <p>WHEREAS, notice of the proposed Sewer Service Charge increase was mailed to ratepayers and property owners on January 11 and 12, 2018, 53 and 52 days respectively prior to the scheduled public hearing on the proposed increase; and</p>
          <p>WHEREAS, a public hearing regarding the proposed Sewer Service Charge is scheduled for March 5, 2018, at 7:00 p.m. in the San Mateo City Hall Council Chambers, located at 330 West 20th Avenue, San Mateo, at which all protests against the rate increase and other comments will be considered; and</p>

          <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="">a.</span> The revenues derived from the Sewer Service Charge do not exceed the funds required to provide sewer service because the rate increase is needed to fund ongoing sewer system and wastewater treatment plant operation and maintenance and meet capital expenditures,</p>
          <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="">b.</span> The revenues derived from the Sewer Service Charge will not be used for any purpose other than the provision of sewer and wastewater treatment service,</p>
          <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="">c.</span> The Sewer Service Charge will not exceed the cost of sewer and wastewater treatment service attributable to each parcel,</p>
          <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="">d.</span> The Sewer Service Charge is only charged for sewer and wastewater treatment service that is actually used by or currently available to the parcel in question,</p>
          <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="">e.</span> The Sewer Service Charge pays for the provision of sewer and wastewater treatment service and not for general governmental services; and</p>
