          <p>WHEREAS, on November 8, 2016, California voters approved Proposition 64 entitled "The Control, Regulate and Tax Adult Use of Marijuana Act" which legalized the possession and use of marijuana by persons 21 years of age and older, and made lawful, subject to state licensing, the cultivation, testing, and sale of nonmedical marijuana; and</p>
          <p>WHEREAS, Proposition 64 added Section 26200 to the <a class="internal-link " href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codesTOCSelected.xhtml?tocCode=BPC&amp;tocTitle=+Public+Utilities+Code+-+BPC" title="">California Business and Professions Code</a> which authorizes the City of San Mateo "to completely prohibit the establishment or operation of one or more types of [marijuana] businesses" made lawful by the proposition; and</p>
          <p>WHEREAS, Proposition 64 added Section 11362.2 to the <a class="internal-link " href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codesTOCSelected.xhtml?tocCode=HSC&amp;tocTitle=+Public+Utilities+Code+-+HSC" title="">California Health and Safety Code</a> which, among other things, permits individuals to grow for their personal use marijuana at their homes, but authorizes the City to prohibit the cultivation of marijuana outdoors upon the grounds of a private residence; and</p>
          <p>WHEREAS, the City Council has concerns about the cultivation, processing and sale of marijuana and marijuana products within the community and the outdoor cultivation of marijuana at private residences, including but not limited to, compatibility of these uses with sensitive neighboring uses, and potential security concerns with the open and obvious cultivation and sale of marijuana and before enacting regulations regarding this conduct would like to study the experience of other jurisdictions to consider best practices and determine what conduct should be authorized; and</p>
          <p>NOW, THEREFORE, THE CITY COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF SAN MATEO FINDS AND ORDAINS AS FOLLOWS:</p>
          <p id="1"><span class="level-num">Section 1. PURPOSE AND INTENT.</span> <a class="internal-link " href="/us/ca/cities/san-mateo/code/1" title="Title 1 GENERAL PROVISIONS">This Chapter</a> is enacted to address the serious health and safety concerns regarding the cultivation, processing and sale of marijuana and marijuana products within the community and the outdoor cultivation of marijuana at private residences, including but not limited to, compatibility of these uses with sensitive neighboring uses and potential security concerns with the open and obvious cultivation and sale of marijuana.</p>

          <p id="3"><span class="level-num">Section 3. ENVIRONMENTAL DETERMINATION.</span> In accordance with CEQA Guidelines section 15378(a), adoption of this ordinance is not a "project" subject to CEQA, because the ordinance has no potential to result in either a direct physical change in the environment, or a reasonably foreseeable indirect physical change in the environment. Even if adoption of this ordinance did constitute a "project," it would be exempt from CEQA in accordance with CEQA Guidelines section 15061(b)(3), because it can be seen with certainty that there is no possibility that the activity in question may have a significant impact on the environment. The purpose of this urgency ordinance is to preserve the status quo while the City studies the potential adverse impacts of commercial marijuana enterprises and the outdoor cultivation of marijuana at private residences.</p>
          <p id="4"><span class="level-num">Section 4.
