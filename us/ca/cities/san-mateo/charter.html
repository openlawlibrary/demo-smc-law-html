Such a temporary ordinance may be adopted with or without amendment at the meeting at which it is introduced and may be made effective immediately, and shall not be subject to the referendum, but it shall stand repealed on the ninety-first day following its adoption and shall not be renewed or otherwise extended as a temporary or emergency ordinance. It shall be published in the same manner as an emergency ordinance.</p>
